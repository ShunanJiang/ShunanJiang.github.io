I'm now a fourth-year PhD candidate at the UC Berkeley IEOR department. My current research projects focus on the intersection of online learning and operations management problems. I'm honored to be advised by Prof. [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XGXOxQoAAAAJ&hl=en). I'm fortunate to have Prof. [Park Sinchaisri](https://parksinchaisri.github.io/) and Prof. [Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng.ieor.berkeley.edu/) as my thesis committee members. Before my PhD, I received my bachelor degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My undergraduate major is Computer Science and Engineering. In my undergraduate, I used to be a research assistant in [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/index.php/en/) and I was honored to be advised by  Prof. [Zhi-quan Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), researching on the asynchronous multi-sensor registration problem using optimization techniques such as semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and block coordinate descending (BCD). I was fortunate to have an exciting research internship experience in [Sensetime Group Limited](https://www.sensetime.com/) under Prof. [Ping Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aXdjxb4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from December 2017 to March 2018, building a large-scale fashion clothing dataset and combing ResNet with DNC (Differentiable Neural Computer). Besides research, I’m the co-founder of Sun Never Sets Studio, which is a student software development start-up studio focusing on improving CUHK(SZ)'s IT system. We have developed the university's WeChat campus card and miniapp voluntarily, which integrates information related to students' daily lives.
