I'm now a first year PhD student at UC Berkeley IEOR department. I received my bachelor degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My undergraduate major is Computer Science and Engineering. I used to be a research assistant in [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/index.php/en/) under Prof. [Zhi-quan Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), researching on the asychronous multi-sensor registration problem using optimization techniques such as semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and block coordinate descending (BCD). I used to be an intern researcher in [Sensetime Group Limited](https://www.sensetime.com/) under Prof. [Ping Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aXdjxb4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from December 2017 to March 2018, building a large-scale fashion clothing dataset and combing ResNet with DNC (Differentiable Neural Computer). I used to be a teaching assistant for Single Variable Calculus course and Multivariable Calculus course. I’m the co-founder of Sun Never Sets Studio, which is a student software developement start-up studio focusing on improving our university's IT system. We have developed the university's WeChat campus card and miniapp voluntarily, which integrates information related to students' daily lives.
