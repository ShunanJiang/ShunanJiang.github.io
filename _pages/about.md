I'm now a sixth-year PhD candidate at the UC Berkeley IEOR department. I major in operations research with minors in machine learning and economics. I'm interested in both machine learning and human learning. I'm honored to be advised by Prof. [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XGXOxQoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Park Sinchaisri](https://parksinchaisri.github.io/). I'm also fortunate to have Prof. [Zeyu Zheng](https://zheng.ieor.berkeley.edu/) as my thesis committee members. Before my PhD, I received my bachelor degree from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](http://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). My undergraduate major is Computer Science and Engineering. In my undergraduate, I used to be a research assistant in [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/index.php/en/) and I was honored to be advised by  Prof. [Zhi-quan Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), researching on the asynchronous multi-sensor registration problem using optimization techniques such as semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and block coordinate descending (BCD). I was fortunate to have an exciting research internship experience in [Sensetime Group Limited](https://www.sensetime.com/) under Prof. [Ping Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aXdjxb4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from December 2017 to March 2018, building a large-scale fashion clothing dataset and combing ResNet with DNC (Differentiable Neural Computer). Besides research, Iâ€™m the co-founder of Sun Never Sets Studio, which is a student software development start-up studio focusing on improving CUHK(SZ)'s IT system. We have developed the university's WeChat campus card and miniapp voluntarily, which integrates information related to students' daily lives.
